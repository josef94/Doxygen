/*! \file CheckMotion.cpp
    \brief The main file for the pre-processing.
	
	This class is used for the pre-processing of fast and curious on processor core two. It takes the input video and analyse every frame if there was motion between two successive frames. To analyse this, the frames were subtracted from each other and when there is too much difference, the actual frame will be saved. After all 22â€™500 frames were analysed, the video will be deleted and the process is terminated.

<div class="textblock"><h1><a class="anchor" id="Aim"></a>
Aim</h1>
<p>The aim of Fast and Curious was to develop a system. As a single device, it should be able to count vehicle drivers, categorize them and give a rough statement about its speed. As a system of devices, it should be possible to make a statistical statement about the driving behaviour of the recorded drivers. There were also surrounding conditions like deep costs and long term. The entire system should be operational in all weather conditions and could be placed at the roadside of a maximum two-lane road. The device should be attached to a street lamp at a height of six meters. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Hardware"></a>
Hardware</h1>
<p>A single device consists of a computing unit with a quad-core processor, which can process several processes in parallel. This is necessary to ensure an almost real-time evaluation. To identify the drivers individually, a camera with a high frame rat but low resolution is used. To be able to do the calculations on every street lamp, an external power supply is required, which makes the device operational over several days. To ensure that the device is in the correct position, a WIFI adapter is used to connect to an external device. The user must activate a hotspot on the mobile phone which the device is connected. The device can be controlled and monitored using the special Fast and Curious website. To be able to justify the camera parallel to the road, a live stream of the camera position is displayed on the website. This can be used to adjust the device and start it if the adjustment is done. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Software"></a>
Software</h1>
<p>In the operating mode, the first core is constantly recording a video, which is stored after 15 minutes. Another core analyses the recorded video by comparing two consecutive frames. With this method, movements can be detected and images with detected movements can be temporary stored. After the video has been processed, it is removed from the temporary memory. The third core uses the images on which movements have been detected and logically links them to identify a vehicle driver. From this, properties of each driver are extracted and stored in a feature vector. The extracted features include a time stamp, the direction of travel, a counter for the number of counted vehicles per direction, a categorization and a speed classification. This feature vector is later used to reconstruct the traffic flow in a limited area and to make a statistical statement from it. The last core deals with the controlling and monitoring of the other cores. This is necessary to guarantee that sufficient resources are available to the processes always. And, to carry out minor tasks from time to time. This includes the monitoring of the calculation unit and the actions of the web server, so that the userâ€™s input can be responded at all time. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Tests"></a>
Tests</h1>
<p>After the device was developed and initial tests had been carried out, a first field test with several devices was carried out in the township of Satteins in Vorarlberg. Six units were installed at the same time in traffic-relevant locations and kept in operation for a period of several days. On the one hand, the number of traffic counts and the categorization of each unit was collected. On the other hand, the traffic flow in the township of Satteins was statistically reconstructed and represented. With the help of test pictures, which were taken, a high consistency of the traffic flow could be read out. </p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="Prospect"></a>
Prospect</h1>
<p>In further work, the devices could realize a real-time evaluation, which would be available at any time online. For this purpose, the devices either must transfer their data to an online server or transfer it to a host using LoRa-WAN. It could also be possible to expand the devices with additional sensors to record additional traffic relevant data such as volume measurements, weather conditions or pollution measurements. </p>
